## 10/5/2025 - Day 12

### In this project, you can input the current hour and minute, and my program will calculate how many minutes have passed since the start of the day and how are left until the end!

&nbsp;

## Examples
```
Input
What hours is it now (0-23)? 16
What minutes is it now (0-59)? 47

Output
1007 minutes have passed since the start of the day.
433 minutes are left until the end of the day.
```

## Creation
#### I created this project by implementing functions with `def` and using a `while` loop!
